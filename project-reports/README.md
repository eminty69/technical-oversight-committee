# TOC Project Review & Presentation Reports

These reviews are required for **every FINOS project** to ensure transparency, health, alignment with the FINOS mission, and governance.

Project reviews are used to:
* Determine the health and trajectory of a project.
* Identify where the TOC can support the project.
* Share interesting milestones with member companies and the wider community.

# Submitting Project Updates

Project reports are to be submitted as a pull request to the `toc/project-reports` under current year folder. 

## The Review Process
